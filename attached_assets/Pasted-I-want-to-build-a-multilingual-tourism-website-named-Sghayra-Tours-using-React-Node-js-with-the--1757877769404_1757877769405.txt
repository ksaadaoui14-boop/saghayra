I want to build a multilingual tourism website named "Sghayra Tours" using React + Node.js with the following requirements:

- **Tourism features:**
  - Camel riding tours (2 to 10 days, customizable group size)
  - Traditional dinners and meals in the desert
  - Local cultural activities (music, dance, henna, crafts, etc.)
  - Group bookings for festivals and carnivals
  - Transport services (pickup, drop-off)
  - Gallery with photos and videos

- **Smart booking system:**
  - Choose activity
  - Select number of people
  - Calendar availability
  - Automatic calculation of price
  - Advance payment of 10% online (Stripe / PayPal integration)
  - Multi-currency support: TND (Tunisian Dinar), USD, EUR
  - Prices update dynamically based on chosen currency

- **Admin Dashboard (React + Node backend, protected login):**
  - Manage activities (add, edit, delete, change prices, change translations)
  - Manage articles & annonces (blog posts, promotions, news)
  - Manage reservations (view, confirm, cancel)
  - Manage payments (see paid / pending / deposits)
  - Export data (CSV / Excel)
  - Dashboard should allow full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) for all content

- **Multilingual support:**
  - 4 languages: French, English, German, Arabic (RTL support)
  - Use i18next with JSON translation files
  - Admin dashboard should also allow updating translations dynamically

- **Design requirements:**
  - Responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Desert-inspired design (sand, ochre, blue night)
  - Smooth animations, immersive homepage with video/photo background
  - Simple but modern UI (Tailwind recommended)

- **Technical:**
  - Frontend: React (with react-router, react-i18next, Tailwind)
  - Backend: Node.js + Express (with MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
  - Authentication for admin
  - SEO optimized
  - Secure (HTTPS, GDPR compliance)
  - Optionally integrate a smart assistant (AI chatbot with OpenAI API) for guiding users

Please generate:

- Example locale files (`en.json`, `fr.json`, `de.json`, `ar.json`)
- Example component for booking with multi-currency switcher (TND, USD, EUR)
